# Introduction

- 🦭 Podman Desktop is an open source graphical tool to work with 🦭 containers and :sailboat: Kubernetes from your local environment.

- 📦 Podman Desktop supports the three major workstation platforms: you can install [on Windows](/docs/installation/windows-install), [on macOS](/docs/installation/macos-install), and [on Linux](/docs/installation/linux-install).
- 🚪 If your environment does not allow you to download resources at runtime, checkout how to [get started on network restricted environments](/docs/proxy).

## Need containers?

- 🪄 On Windows and macOS, Podman Desktop manages your Podman engine in a virtual machine: the Podman machine.
- ⚓ You can configure your environment to [continue using tools that work with Docker](/docs/migrating-from-docker).
- 🦭 You get a GUI for your container workloads: [setup your registries](/docs/containers/registries), [build, push, and pull images](/docs/containers/images), [start a container](/docs/containers/starting-a-container), or start a container group [with Compose](/docs/compose), and even better [work with pods on your container engine](/docs/containers/creating-a-pod).

## Need Kubernetes?

- 🪄 You can setup your Kubernetes engine: [Red Hat Developer Sandbox](/docs/openshift/developer-sandbox), [Kind](/docs/kind), [Lima](/docs/lima), [Minikube](/docs/minikube), or [Red Hat OpenShift Local](/docs/openshift/openshift-local).
- 🤝 You can also [connect to an existing Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes/existing-kubernetes).
- ⛵ You get a GUI for your Kubernetes workloads: [select the current Kubernetes context](/docs/kubernetes/viewing-and-selecting-current-kubernete-context), [deploy a container](/docs/kubernetes/deploying-a-container-to-kubernetes), [deploy a pod](/docs/kubernetes/deploying-a-pod-to-kubernetes).
