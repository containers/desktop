# Troubleshooting

If you cannot find your issue here or in the documentation, please fill an issue on our [repository](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues). You can also explore the [discussions](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/discussions) and do a search on similar issues on the [repository](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues).

## Podman Issues

### Getting Started

System Requirements

The tool connects to Podman using the socket on the host on macOS and on a named pipe on Windows. This is available only on podman 4.0.2+
So, please check your version and update.

On Windows, the named pipe is `//./pipe/docker_engine` when Docker Desktop is not installed. It will be solved by https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/13502 / https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/13655. During that time, you may start Docker Desktop so the named pipe is the one expected.

#### Solution: Check connection

Check at least a podman machine is running on Windows & macOS:

```bash
podman machine list
```

And check a connection can be made with the CLI

```sh
$ podman run quay.io/podman/hello
!... Hello Podman World ...!

         .--"--.

### Unable to locate Podman Engine

#### Issue: 
Despite having Podman Engine installed, you may receive an error as follows -
```Error: No such keg: /usr/local/Cellar/podman```
or any similar error denoting that Podman Engine does not exist. 

#### Explanation: 
The Podman Installer and Homebrew use different locations to store the Podman Engine files in the file system. For example, Podman Installer installs Podman Engine in the path `/opt/podman` whereas Homebrew uses the path `/usr/local` for macOS Intel, `/opt/homebrew` for Apple Silicon and `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` for Linux.

#### Solution: 
To check where exactly is your Podman Engine installed, run the command `which podman`. This returns the path where the Podman Engine would be installed. This would help determine further action. 

For example, if youâ€™re looking to completely uninstall Podman Engine from your system for a fresh installation, running `which podman` returns the exact path where Podman still exists. This could be the path where Podman Installer stores Podman Engine i.e. `/opt/podman`. Once you know the path, simply run 

`sudo rm -rf /opt/podman`

Or 

`sudo rm -rf path-where-podman-exists`

Here, you would replace `path-where-podman-exists` with the output of `which podman`.

You can now proceed for a fresh installation of Podman Desktop

## Code Ready Containers

- Check that podman preset is defined. (`crc config get preset`)
- Check that `crc` binary is available in the user PATH (`/usr/local/bin/crc`)
- Check that `crc setup --check-only` is running without errors.

## Other Issues

### Fixing corrupted Podman Machine in Windows

If at all you are not able to stop your Podman Machine, you will find such an error in the Logs-
```Error: Error stopping sysd: exit status 1```

It is highly unlikely that you may be stuck in such a situation but if you are, here's a quick fix for it.

Assuming the name of the Podman Machine to be `my-machine`, run the following commands in the terminal:

```sh
wsl --list
```

This shall display a list of active distributions i.e. `my-machine` in this case.

Then,

```sh
wsl --unregister my-machine
```
(Replacing `my-machine` with the name that is displayed under `wsl --list` for your Podman Machine)

This will stop the Podman Machine for you.
