# Installing the Kind extension

:::note

Kind is a _built-in_ extension to Podman Desktop and no installation is necessary.

:::

The Kind extension provides the capability of creating a local Kubernetes cluster using only containers rather than a Virtual Machine.

#### Procedure

[Install Podman Desktop](/docs/installation) to have the extension available. To confirm the built-in extension is installed, you can find Kind within the **Extensions** section of Podman Desktop.

#### Tutorial

The following video provides a complete guide on creating a single-node cluster:
