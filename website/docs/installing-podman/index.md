Podman Desktop doesn't install the Podman container engine automatically, to let you choose your container engine.

Consider installing the Podman container engine to benefit from Podman features:

* Added security
* No daemon
* Open source
* Rootless

You can use Podman in addition to another container engine, such as Docker or Lima.

Follow the procedures for your operating system:

* [Installing Podman on Windows](./installing-podman/installing-podman-on-windows)
* [Installing Podman on macOS](./installing-podman/installing-podman-on-macos)
* [Installing Podman on Linux](./installing-podman/installing-podman-on-linux)
