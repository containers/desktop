# Working with OpenShift

With Podman Desktop, you can work on [OpenShift-powered](https://openshift.com/) Kubernetes clusters.

To get started, configure access to an OpenShift cluster, and optionally, create the cluster:

- [Creating an OpenShift Local cluster](openshift/creating-an-openshift-local-cluster).
- [Configuring access to a Developer Sandbox](openshift/configuring-access-to-a-developer-sandbox).
