# Installing Podman Desktop

You can install Podman Desktop on:

* [Windows](./installation/windows-install)
* [macOS](./installation/macos-install)
* [Linux](./installation/linux-install)

Podman Desktop doesn't install the Podman container engine automatically, to let you choose your container engine.

Consider installing the Podman container engine to benefit from Podman features:

* Added security
* No daemon
* Open source
* Rootless

You can use Podman in addition to another container engine, such as Docker or Lima.
