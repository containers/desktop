## Installing Podman Desktop on MacOS using .dmg file

In order to install Podman Desktop and start running containers, you need to download the .dmg file from the [Downloads](/downloads/macos) section of this website. 

While we recommend getting the "universal" binary file which will work irrespective of the chip architecture your Mac possesses, you also have the option to get the applicable .dmg file depending on your Mac Hardware Architecture (i.e. Intel or Apple M1).

### 1. Download the file

Simply download the file of your choice from the [Downloads](/downloads/macos) section and open it in your machine to install Podman Desktop.

Once you open it, the system will prompt you to drag the icon to the Applications folder.

After which, you are just a click away from using Podman Desktop. You can find Podman Desktop either on the 'Launchpad' or Mac's 'Applications' directory.

### 2. Check for Prerequisites

When you open Podman Desktop for the first time, click on the "View detection checks" button to see if all the prerequisites to use Podman Desktop are met. If it says `‚ùå podman cli was not found in the PATH`, then you need to install the Podman CLI/Engine which can be done within the application. You can read more about Podman Engine [here](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/).

## Installing Podman Desktop on MacOS using [brew](https://brew.sh/).

The following command will help you install Podman Desktop on your Mac through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). So make sure you have that installed and set up. 

To install Podman Desktop, simply run the command below:

```sh
brew install podman-desktop
