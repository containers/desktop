## Installing Podman Desktop on MacOS using .dmg file

**1. Download the `.dmg` file from the [Downloads](/downloads/macos) section of this website.**

While we recommend getting the "universal" binary file which will work irrespective of the chip architecture your Mac possesses, you also have the option to get the applicable .dmg file depending on your Mac Hardware Architecture (i.e. Intel or Apple M1).

**2. Locate the downloaded file and and double-click on it. (Usually, you will find the downloaded file in the Downloads folder)**

**5. Install Podman from Podman Desktop, if not yet installed.** 

When you open Podman Desktop for the first time, click on the "View detection checks" button to scan if all the prerequisites to use Podman Desktop are met. If it says `‚ùå podman cli was not found in the PATH`, then you need to install the Podman CLI/Engine which can be done within the application.

Click on the "Install" button next to the "View detection checks" button, and follow the instructions on screen. 
You will be redirected to the Podman Installer. Follow the instructions on screen and enter your system password when asked.
