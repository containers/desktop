# Installing a Podman Desktop extension

Installing an extension is a great way to expand the capability of Podman Desktop.

#### Prerequisites

- Extensions are packaged as container images. The extension will either direct you to the catalog tab, or provide you with a link to the image (ex. `quay.io/example/extension-name`).

#### Procedure

1. Click on the extensions icon.

#### Verification

- The extension can be verified by checking the "Installed" section of the Extensions page.

- Depending on the extension, items can appear in the status bar, tray menu, or other areas of Podman Desktop.
