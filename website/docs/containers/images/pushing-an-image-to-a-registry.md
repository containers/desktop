# Pushing an image to a registry

With Podman Desktop, you can push an image to registries.

#### Prerequisites

- You have configured your registry **<Icon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" size="lg" /> Settings > Registries**.
- You have built an image with the fully qualified name required for your registry, such as `quay.io/my-repository/my-image`, `ghcr.io/my-repository/my-image`, or `docker.io/my-repository/my-image`.
- Ensure that the image name includes the registry where to publish the image. To publish on `quay.io/repository` the image `my-image`, the FQN image name should be `quay.io/repository/my-image`.

#### Procedure

1. Go to **Images** from the left navigation pane.
1. Click the **overflow menu** icon corresponding to the image you want to push and select **Push Image**. The image tag is auto-selected.
