- Podman Desktop is designed and built with the following core values in mind:

## <icon icon="fa-solid fa-bolt" size="4x" /> Fast and Light

- Daemon-less and using the fastest technologies to make Podman Desktop fast to use.

- Reactive and light on resources utilized from your environment.

## <icon icon="fa-solid fa-lock-open" size="4x" /> Open

- While focusing on Podman as a container engine packaged by default, Podman Desktop also enables other container engines.
- This gives the end-user a single tool to manage all their containers independently from the engine used.

## <icon icon="fa-solid fa-gauge-simple-high" size="4x" /> Simple

- Managing a container engine locally can be hard.
- Running Kubernetes in a local environment requires knowledge.
- Podman Desktop takes care of this complexity and enables developers to focus on their code.

## <icon icon="fa-solid fa-puzzle-piece" size="4x" /> Extensible

- Podman Desktop provides extensions points to enable the community to build more features.
- This allows more in-deep integrations with other tools and technologies to extend workflows and capabilities of the tool.
- Thus giving the developer a single tool to manage all their containers independently from the engine used.
