Podman Desktop 0.14 - Our Kind-est release yet!

We have been working on a Kind extension for a while now, and decided it is time to promote it
into the release just in time for KubeCon and CloudNativeCon Europe!

Some of these features were developed in the Kind extension over the last few releases,
but since they are new to you, and they were not in previous release notes, we will do a
roundup and talk about all the Kind features.

<!--Main Features-->

- **Kind Installation**: Install Kind from the status bar
- **Kind Clusters in Resources**: Create and manage Kind clusters from Resources
- **Sharing Images with Kind**: Easily move images to Kind
- **Kind Ingress**: Install an ingress controller
- **UX and UI Improvements**: Updated preferences and telemetry prompt

Podman Desktop 0.14 is now available. [Click here to download it](/downloads)!

## Release details

### Kind Installation

The Kind extension is now bundled as part of Podman Desktop [1421](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1421)
and allows you to easily [install Kind directly from the status bar](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/kubernetes/kind/installing-kind) [1257](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1257).
The installed `kind` CLI is available from the system shell [1516](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1516).

### Kind Clusters in Resources

[Create Kind clusters from an updated **Settings > Resources** page](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/kubernetes/kind/creating-a-kind-cluster) that also allows you to start/stop [1953](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1953) and delete [1977](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1977) them.

### Share Images with Kind

It is easy to move images from Podman to Kind [1448](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1448).

### Ingress

If you deploy a pod to Kind, you are going to want to reach it, so we have made it easy to install an ingress
controller (Contour) [1675](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1675).

### UI and UX improvements

#### Updated Preferences

The **Settings > Preferences** page has been updated with a new design [1913](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1913),
making it easier to see and change preferences. Changes are live, no more Update button.

#### Telemetry Prompt

The prompt to enable or disable telemetry has been moved from its own dialog into the **Welcome** screen.
[1927](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1927)
This is more usable, one less prompt, and solves a window-layering issue for some users!
