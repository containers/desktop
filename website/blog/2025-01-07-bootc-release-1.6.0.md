[BootC (Bootable Container) is an extension](https://github.com/podman-desktop/extension-bootc) for Podman Desktop that builds bootable _container_ disk images. Go from a standard container image to a full bootable-on-a-usb-stick OS!

You can update or install the extension [via the Podman Desktop extension catalog.](/docs/extensions/install)

This release introduces exciting new features and improvements:

- **Detailed example pages:** Each example now has a dedicated page with detailed instructions on how to use it.
- **Interactive build configuration creator:** Easily create your build configuration through a fillable form directly in the GUI.
- **Experimental Linux VM support:** Added support for running Linux VMs on generated images.
