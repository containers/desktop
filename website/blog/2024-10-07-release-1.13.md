## Release Details

### Hyper-V support

Podman Desktop is now supporting the creation and modification of Hyper-V based Podman machines on Windows directly from the app.
When creating a Podman machine in Windows, if both Hyper-V and WSL are enabled, you can choose either one of them as the provider from the dropdown menu.

### Search image feature

As you type, a list of likely images is now shown to help you find the right one and reduce typing. If you would like to search for a specific tag, just add : to the name.

### Updated empty state pages

We have updated the empty state pages for images, containers, pods, and Kubernetes. You can now pull your first image, create your first container or pod, all with only one click.

### New Kubernetes navigation

As we grew our Kubernetes section and added new Kubernetes related pages, the navigation was becoming a bit crowded. For a better user experience, this release includes a new Kubernetes submenu with all the relevant pages in it.

### Image layer explorer extension

You can now see each layer of any image you have in Podman Desktop using the `Image Layers Explorer` extension from the extensions catalog. After downloading the extension, choose any image from the available image list, go to the `Files` tab in the `Image Details` page, click on `Fetch Layers`, and start exploring.

### Docker compatibility mode page

Try out our new experimental Docker compatibility page where you can view information about the Docker compatibility mode.
Go to Settings -> Preferences, and enable the option in the `Experimental (Docker Compatibility)` section. You'll then see the Docker compatibility page show up in the Settings menu.
