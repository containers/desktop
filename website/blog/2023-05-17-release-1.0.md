## Release Details

### Featured Extensions

A critical part of our vision for Podman Deskop is the ability to install extensions to
support additional container engines, Kubernetes providers, or other tools. However, it
has not been easy to discover new extensions.

With 1.0 we show a list of featured extensions in the **Welcome**
[#2354](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2354), the **Dashboard** and in
**<icon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" size="lg" /> Settings > Extensions**
[#2355](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2355). Check out the new
extensions for **Red Hat OpenShift Local** and the **Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift**!

Have another idea for extending Podman Desktop? We would love to hear from you or see
what you can create with the [Extension documentation](../docs/extensions).

### Podman Machine as Root

When creating a Podman machine you can now decide to run as root [#2427](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2427).

This is a prerequisite in some scenarios, such as running Kind on Windows.

### Other UI and UX Improvements

#### Prompt to Open External Website

In the previous release links to external websites were blocked due to the security risk.
In 1.0 you can click to see the URL and have the option of opening or copying it
[#2414](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2414).

#### Editable Numeric Preferences

Tired of clicking +, +, +? Us too. Numeric preferences are now editable so
you can directly enter the value you want
[#2368](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2368).

![Editing numbers](img/podman-desktop-release-1.0/edit-number.png)

#### Navigation tooltips

We like our new navigation bar, but the tooltips were slow to appear. This made it harder for new
users to discover the pages and for power users to see the container/pod/image counts. The
tooltips are now a little nicer and appear immediately
[#2286](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2286).

## Other Notable Enhancements

- If you use a non-default Podman machine you are now prompted to make it the default, so
  that command line tools will use the same machine [#2205](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2205).

- Extensions can now be installed without requiring a running local container engine
  [#2273](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2273).

- When extensions fail to load there is a new state (failed!) and an error message
  to help you fix or report the problem [#2424](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2424).

- The showInputBox API has support for Markdown [#2418](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2418).

## Notable Bug Fixes

- Fixed shared status when using multiple Podman 4.5 machines [#2441](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2441).
- Fixed hang on exit when telemetry is unreachable [#2431](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2431).
