## Release details

### Update to Podman v4.5

Podman Desktop 0.15 embeds [Podman 4.5](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v4.5) in
Windows and macOS installers [#2115](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2115).

### Kind Ingress

Wait a minute, didn't we enable this last release? Well yes, last time we did add support for installing
the Contour ingress controller on Kind [#1675](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1675),
but you still couldn't access your containers without the corresponding ingress configuration.

This release adds a simple checkbox you can use when deploying to Kind to make your app accessible
[#1322](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/1322).

### Podliness: Define Ports when Podifying

When you create a pod from of a set of containers (podifying!), you probably don't want to expose every
single port to the world. With an updated panel you can now see which ports your containers
expose and pick which should remain visible outside the pod and which are for internal use
[#2232](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2232).

### Cleanliness: New Navigation Bar, Dialogs, and Palette

It was time to catch up on some design ideas and do some UI cleanup!

#### New Navgation Bar
The navigation bar is now always fixed on the left size, without labels. This opens up more space
for the content on each page, and is easier to jump in and out of **Settings**.
[#2167](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2167)

#### Updated Dialogs
We wanted messages and dialog boxes to feel a bit more integrated, so we have a new message box
[#1808](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1808) and use it for all dialogs opened by
extensions, pruning containers/pods/images/volumes [#2138](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2138),
and updating Podman Desktop itself [#2249](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2249).

TODO: better image

#### Colors
We spent some time tweaking colors and closing on our final palette
[#2199](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2199), updating the colors in the terminal & detail page
[#2222](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2222), tweaking the navigation and main page colors
[#2223](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2223),
and improving the look of forms [#2156](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2156).

We're not done yet, but hopefully you will notice a more polished, consistent, good-looking application!

### Other UI and UX improvements

#### Settings

The **Settings > Preferences** page has been updated with a new 


#### Markdown, Markdown Everywhere

We added a new component to display markdown [#2219](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2219) and
enabled it in preferences [#2253](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/2253), and
provider properties/creation pages [#2152](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/issues/2152).
