## Release Details

### Experimental Light Mode ðŸ’¡

We're excited to announce the arrival of our most-requested feature: light mode! You can now enjoy a brighter interface by toggling the light mode option in the **<icon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" size="lg" />Settings > Preferences** section. Thank you for your patience as we continue to implement light mode for better accessibility! Please note, this feature is currently experimental as we continue to optimize the rest of Podman Desktop for this new mode.

### macOS Rosetta Support for Apple Silicon

Podman Desktop 1.11 proudly introduces support for macOS Rosetta, facilitating seamless integration with Apple Silicon. This update, part of Podman 5.1, allows users to enable or disable Rosetta support directly through the Podman Settings. With this enhancement, running AMD64 image builds or containers achieves speeds that are nearly identical to those experienced on ARM64 architectures. For more details on the implementation, visit the [GitHub podman pull request](https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/21670).

### Kubernetes Enhancements

In our latest release, we've enhanced Kubernetes functionality by adding node and volume listings. This update aims to improve your Kubernetes management experience within Podman Desktop.

### User Interface Improvements

Take a moment to appreciate the upgraded user interface of Podman Desktop. You'll find that the container listing section, among others, has received significant enhancements, elevating your overall user experience.

### Enhanced Manifest Support

We've made strides in how we handle manifest images. Multi-arch images are now grouped under the manifest, simplifying the process and enhancing efficiency.
