![podman-desktop-hero-1.12](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/banner.png)

Podman Desktop 1.12 is now available. [Click here to download it](/downloads)!

This release includes:

- **Podman remote**: We now support remote Podman setups! Manage your remote Podman machines all within the UI.
- **macOS GPU support**: Container GPU access on macOS is now available. [`libkrun`](https://github.com/containers/libkrun) is now a selectable provider type to allow GPU passthrough enablement.
- **Windows GPU support**: Want to try out Windows GPU support too? Podman already supports it, but we are now showcasing it in our [AI Lab extension](https://podman-desktop.io/extensions/ai-lab)
- **Podman 5.2.0**: This new version of Podman provides GPU access for macOS, as well as a host of [new features](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v5.2.0).
- **Light mode out of experimental**: Our light mode has been well-received, and we have now marked it as non-experimental! Enjoy the new theme.
- **Kubernetes features**: ConfigMaps, Secrets and multi-file Kubernetes YAML applying have now been added to our Kubernetes dashboard.
- **Improved font consistency**: You'll notice a big difference in consistency this release, as we updated all font sizes throughout Podman Desktop.

## Release Details

### Podman remote

We now support remote Podman sessions! Use Podman Desktop to interact with remote instances over SSH. This allows both container and image management.

You can enable this in the **Preferences** section of Podman Desktop:

![remote](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/remote.png)

To set up access to a remote machine, follow the official [Podman remote-client tutorial](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/remote_client.md).

### macOS GPU support

GPU support is now available for macOS users!

This seamless setup can be enabled during Podman Machine creation by selecting the provider type:

![libkrun](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/libkrun.png)

After enablement, you can test that the GPU has been supported by running a custom container with `--device /dev/dri` passed through:

```sh
$ podman run --rm -it --device /dev/dri --name gpu-info quay.io/slopezpa/fedora-vgpu vulkaninfo | grep "GPU"
```

Which will output information regarding your GPU:

```sh

		GPU id = 0 (Virtio-GPU Venus (Apple M1 Pro))
		GPU id = 1 (llvmpipe (LLVM 17.0.6, 128 bits))
GPU0:
	deviceType        = PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_INTEGRATED_GPU
	deviceName        = Virtio-GPU Venus (Apple M1 Pro)
GPU1:
```

Stay tuned as we continue to improve and write documentation on GPU support.

The most practical way to try these new features out is by installing [AI Lab (>1.2.3)](https://podman-desktop.io/extensions/ai-lab) and seeing the improved speed.

This can be done by following the below steps:

1. **Update to the latest Podman AI Lab extension (v1.2.3)** from the Extensions Catalog on Podman Desktop.
2. Create a new Podman Machine with `libkrun` enabled (see above instructions).
3. Enable GPU support within Podman AI Lab extension:

![ai_lab](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/ai_lab.png)

4. Start an inference server / playground environment and enjoy the benefits of accelerated GPU support!

### Windows GPU support

Windows GPU support has been integrated into Podman for a while, however our associated extensions have now been utilizing this great feature! Such as in [AI Lab](https://podman-desktop.io/extensions/ai-lab).

To showcase this awesome feature, this can be done by following the below steps:

1. **Update to the latest Podman AI Lab extension** from the Extensions Catalog on Podman Desktop.
2. Create a Podman Machine with WSL enabled.
3. Enable GPU support within the Podman AI Lab Extension:

![ai_lab](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/ai_lab.png)

4. Start an inference server / playground environment and enjoy the benefits of accelerated GPU support!

### Light mode out of experimental

We've made excellent progress in light mode and we have now marked it out of non-experimental! If you have not already tried it yet, this can be enabled within the interface here:

![light mode](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/light_mode.png)

### Kubernetes features

With this release, you can now view ConfigMaps as well as Secrets:

![configmaps secrets](img/podman-desktop-release-1.12/configmaps_secrets.png)

You also have the ability to now select multiple files when applying your Kubernetes YAML.
