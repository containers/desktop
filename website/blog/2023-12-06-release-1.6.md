## Release Details

### Minikube featured extension
For developers who need to run Kubernetes locally and reproduce an environment close to production for development and experimentation purposes, Podman Desktop allows users to easily set up that environment on a local machine. There are two distincts extensions providing the capability to configure a Kubernetes cluster locally, you can either choose between [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/).

The minikube extension allows to setup a Kubernetes cluster locally running in a container! Yeah, you read well, in a container, in a similar fashion than Kind. The advantage is that it's lighter and faster to start. With minikube, one of the advantage, is that you can build your images locally with podman and get them automatically available in your local Kubernetes cluster -  which will speed up your turnarounds when you want to test your application. If you want to learn more about

### Command-Line Tools Configuration: Compose and Kubectl
Configuring and managing your setup is getting easier with the addition of a new section in the Settings to manage Command-line tools. In Podman Desktop, extensions can bring dependencies and tools that are going to be necessary for working properly. 

Two Command-Line tools are getting registered at the moment Compose and kubectl:
- Compose-cli is registered by the Compose extension. 
- kubectl is a dependency needed with Podman Desktop.

//TODO add recording

From the settings you can see the command-line tools that are installed, you can see the version - and when a new version is available, you'll get a small notification to allow you easily updating that dependency.

### Kubernetes Contexts Manager
We are introducing a new screen available from the settings allowing to easily manage your Kubernetes contexts. Podman Desktop was already providing the handy context switcher available from the status bar, but when you get to work with multiple Kubernetes environments, it's not uncommon to ended with a big and long list of Kubernetes contexts.

The new Kubernetes Contexts screen allows you to easily see all your registered Kubernetes contexts. You can use that screen to cleanup your registered contexts, and also to define the context you want to be using by default.

### Editable Podman Machine 
A Podman machine is a virtual environment specifically designed to run Podman containers on Mac and Windows. It allows users to manage and operate containerized applications in an isolated and controlled setting. When creating a Podman machine, you configure its settings: memory, CPU(s) and disk Size. 

We've got feedback from some of you, interested by the ability to reconfigured your Podman machine on the go. This is now possible and particularly useful when you started with an environment and need to scale it up base on new needs and containers you would like to run in your Podman environment. 

// TODO add recording

You'll also notice, we improved the sliders to configure the Podman machine's options - and we also introduced a way to enter numeric values directly. 


### Tabs/Filters for Containers and Pods
Being able to quickly identify the containers and the pods you are working with is critical when you iterating on the development of your application. For this reason, we added filters at the top of the lists of Containers and Pods that allow you to easily see either see all the containers/pods, only those who are running or only those who are stopped.

// TODO add recording


### Sorting for Volumes and Images lists
The lists of Volumes and Images are getting improved and are now getting the ability to be sorted by the criteria of your choice. You can for example filter images by their size - which can be convenient when you want to clean up your environment. 

// TODO add recording


### Environment colums on Containers and Pods lists
Podman Desktop is able to work with multiple providers: it could work with multiple container engines and multiple kubernetes environments too. In order to make it easier to identify the containers and the pods and differentiate them depending on which environment they are running onto, we are introducing a new environment columns in the list of Containers and Pods to display a badge. 

// TODO screenshot

#### Better visibility to the containers running in Pods

The list of Pods has been refined to provide easier visibility and access to the containers running into each of them. Each of the containers now have one dot and you can hover each dot to display the info about the container - and if you click on it you'll be able to access the details of the container.

// TODO add recording
