## Release Details

### 1 Million Downloads! üéâ

We've hit over 1 million downloads of Podman Desktop since we started! A big thank you üôè to everyone
who has helped get us to this number - especially those who have opened issues or PRs and contributed
to this success!

Looking forward to the next million! üöÄ

### Extension Catalog

To make it easier to access extensions we added an item to the main navigation and completely revamped
the Extensions page. You can now see and control all your Podman Desktop and Docker Desktop extensions
in a single place. If you want to view more details, click on an extension to see the expanded readme.

With the growing number of extensions available we've also introduced a catalog to make it easy to find
and install them. Check the catalog regularly as we hear there are some exciting new extensions sailing in!

### Podman v5 (5.0.2)

Now that we've had some experience and time to test our migration tools, we're glad to make Podman v5 a
recommended upgrade for all users. Podman Desktop will help ensure you don't lose any data during the
migration. In particular macOS users will see a performance boost as we've switched to the native
Apple Hypervisor.

Find out more details in the blog announcement for ü¶≠ Podman version 5 [here](https://blog.podman.io/2024/03/podman-5-0-has-been-released/).

### Multi-platform Builds

Sticking to one platform keeping you down? Building on the work we did in a recent release to allow building
images for other platforms, you can now select multiple platforms at once. When you do this we will
automatically switch to building an image for each selected platform and then creating a multi-platform
manifest to package them all together.

We still have work to do to allow seamlessly working with images or manifests, so stay tuned for more.

### Extension API Improvements

We've added support for manifests (multi-arch images) to the extension API to give upcoming extensions
more capabilites and even better integration into ü¶≠ Podman Desktop:

- feat: add inspectManifest API endpoint [#6812](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6812)
- feat: add createManifest API [#6630](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/6630)
