## Release Details

### 1 Million Downloads! üéâ

We've hit over 1 million downloads of Podman Desktop since we started! A big thank you üôè to everyone
who has helped get us to this number - especially those who have opened issues or PRs and contributed
to this success!

Looking forward to the next million! üöÄ

### Extension Catalog

To make it easier to access extensions we added an item to the main navigation and completely revamped
the Extensions page. You can now see and control all your Podman Desktop and Docker Desktop extensions
in a single place, and if you want more details just click on an extension to see the readme.

With the growing number of extensions available we've also introduced a catalog to make it easy to find
and install them. Check this page regularly as we hear there are some exciting new extensions sailing in!

### Podman v5 (5.0.2)

Now that we've had some experience and time to test our migration tools, we're glad to make Podman v5 a
recommended upgrade for all users. Podman Desktop will help ensure you don't lose any data during the
migration, and macOS users in particular will enjoy the performance enhancements of
moving to Apple Hypervisor.
