"Summary

"A mailing list for all things Podman (https://github.com/containers/podman)

"Podman manages pods, containers, container images, and container volumes.

"It does so by using the Libpod library, which provides a library for applications looking to use the Container Pod concept, popularized by Kubernetes. 

At a high level, the scope of Podman and libpod is the following:

    Support multiple image formats, including the OCI and Docker image formats.
    Support for multiple means to download images, including trust & image verification.
    Container image management (managing image layers, overlay filesystems, etc.).
    Full management of container lifecycle
    Support for pods to manage groups of containers together
    Resource isolation of containers and pods.
    Integration with CRI-O to share containers and backend code.

"This project tests all builds against each supported version of Fedora, the latest released version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and the latest Ubuntu Long Term Support release. The community has also reported success with other Linux flavors and is expanding into Windows and macOS.
